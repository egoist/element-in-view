## Features

- Small and focus, only **580 bytes** and exports a single function.
- Supporting all modern browsers and IE9+.

## Comparison

Comparing to [in-viewport](https://github.com/vvo/in-viewport) and [in-view](https://github.com/camwiegert/in-view), `element-in-view` only exports a function for checking if an element is in viewport, handling events and other stuffs are left to user-land. In fact, this library is extracted from [in-view](https://github.com/camwiegert/in-view), I tried to use that library in [vue-mugen-scroll](https://github.com/egoist/vue-mugen-scroll), but I need to use a custom logic to handle events, so many features in `in-view` become useless, that's why this library exists.

## Install

```bash
yarn add element-in-view
```

## API

Note that the API doc is partially extracted from [in-view](https://github.com/camwiegert/in-view#api).

### inView(element, [options])

#### element

A DOM [Element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element).

#### options

##### options.offset

Type: `Number` `object`<br>
Default: `0`

By default, `element-in-view` considers something in viewport if it breaks any edge of the viewport. This can be used to set an offset from that edge. For example, an offset of `100` will consider elements in viewport if they break any edge of the viewport by at least `100` pixels. offset can be a positive or negative integer.

Offset can also be set per-direction by passing an object.

```js
{
  top: 100,
  right: 75,
  bottom: 50,
  left: 25
}
```

##### options.threshold

Type: `Number`<br>
Default: `0`

Set the ratio of an element's height and width that needs to be visible for it to be considered in viewport. This defaults to `0`, meaning any amount. A threshold of `0.5` or `1` will require that half or all, respectively, of an element's height and width need to be visible. threshold must be a number between `0` and `1`.
